      The rise of digital currencies over the past few decades means that everything you do is on the blockchain. And the blockchain is immutable, which means it can't be changed. In addition, privacy issues have become a hot topic after leaks that the NSA is spying on everyone and the well-known fact that tech companies like Google and Facebook are collecting all the data. This has led to a high demand for a digital crypto-currency that cannot be tracked. Fortunately, there are solutions that offer both privacy/anonymity and digital use. The most popular of these private crypto-currencies (privacy coins) is Monero.

      Monero presents itself as an anonymous crypto-currency.

      Is Monero Anonymous?
    </h2>

    <p>
      This article will offer a conclusive answer about the privacy of Monero. In addition to that. The purpose of this article was to clearly explain how monero anonymity operates.
    </p>

    <p>
      As mentioned before, Monero presents itself as an anonymous coin with untraceable transactions. But is it true? Yes, Monero is virtually untraceable at the moment. Could it be traceable and it's not common knowledge? Can one break the Monero anonymity? Of course, it could be. But all the evidence points to Monero being untraceable, so that's the most logical answer. That said, Monero is probably not as private as you think, at least without taking the necessary precautions.

      Ensuring anonymity with Monero It's important to note that you'll probably remain anonymous without using these steps. However, following these basic guidelines will increase the chances that your identity will remain private. I2P or a VPN with Monero is mandatory. The most important step you can take to ensure your privacy with Monero is to use a tool that masks your IP address. Tor,

      How Monero Anonymity works?
    </h2>

    <p>
      Monero privacy using Ring CT (confidential transactions) creates a transaction so that the outputs are mixed with similar outputs from the entire UTXO (transaction output set) without revealing the amounts to anyone.

      Tor, I2P or VPN for Monero?
    </h2>

    <p>
      The key is that you don't want your IP address to be public because nodes can see your IP address. Subsequently, the IP address can be linked to a transaction with a concerted effort. The good news is that this is unlikely to actually happen to you. The even better news is that both Tor and I2P are free. They are also the two best options for maintaining security. Another important process to ensure anonymity on Monero is to send Monero to several different wallets. Again, there is no need to do this step as Monero is already secure enough. With that out of the way.

    <h2 class="heading --h3">
      Can Monero be traced ?
    </h2>

    <p>
      Yes, Monero probably has flaws that have not been discovered. This is obviously not a problem at the moment. However, it becomes a bigger problem because the blockchain is immutable. This means that it cannot be changed. It also exists forever, which means that once the technology exists to track it, it can be used to track every transaction on the blockchain. That said, it's not something to particularly worry about because there's nothing you can do to prevent something from happening in the future. The best advice is to follow the guidelines mentioned above to ensure privacy and hope that privacy is maintained if the blockchain can ever be tracked. Now.

      De-Anonymize Monero
    </h2>

    <p>
      U.S. Treasury awarded two $625,000 contracts to two blockchain analytics companies in September 2020. The purpose of the contract? To develop software can identify the identity of wallets on privacy coin blockchains like Monero. There have been numerous attempts to break the Monero anonymity. Specifically, the software should allow an agent to enter an address and then link an identity to the address. The software is apparently intended to track hackers using ransomware. However, it will likely be used for more than just ransomware. So, what's the good news with this software? The government is just starting to look for a solution to the problem. This means that they probably have no way to track Monero at the moment. Plus, it gives Monero developers enough time to come up with a solution that makes the tracking software useless. Another positive is that $625,000 seems like a pretty small amount of money for a software company to develop a solution that can track something as complicated as Monero. To summarize, the government is looking for a way to crack Monero. This means that: Monero cannot be found at the moment hence the need for the solution Monero may not be found in the future

      Why use Monero Anonymity?
    </h2>

    <p>
      The main attraction of Monero anonymity is that it is untraceable by default. Of course, Bitcoin is untraceable with a lot of work using cups and taps. Monero, on the other hand, uses all of these features, and more, by default. It is one step ahead of Bitcoin when it comes to traceability. In fact, Bitcoin is not really anonymous because wallet transactions, transaction amounts and wallet addresses are all public. A determined analyst could fairly easily track bitcoin through the blockchain until he or she encounters an interaction with an exchange that can link an identity to bitcoin.

      Final thoughts about Monero Anonymity
    </h3>

    <p>
      This covers the anonymity and traceability of Monero. Yes, Monero is anonymous and untraceable at the moment. It's obviously not 100%, but it's about as close to 100% as a private coin can get. Anonymity can be increased by always using TOR and sending Monero to a few different wallets that you control.
